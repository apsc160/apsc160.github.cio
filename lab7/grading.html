              <h3>Grading</h3>
              <p>
                When first learning to program, it is a common misconception that
                you will get 100% if your program simply meets the specifications
                - i.e., does what it's supposed to do. When designing cars or bridges,
                we give consideration to aesthetics, process and documentation,
                as well as functionality. The same is true of software design.
              </p>
              <p>
                The program that you write in the lab will be submitted for marking
                through Connect. You must ensure that you have uploaded the correct
                files before leaving the lab. Thus, it is important that you carefully
                go through the submission procedure, and make sure that you get a
                confirmation message. Any copy that you have on the machine in the
                lab will be deleted when you leave the lab. If your code is not
                submitted to Connect, we will have no work to mark and you will end up
                with a grade of zero!
              </p>

              When your code is marked, the following aspects will be taken into consideration:
              <ul>
                <li>The program must meet the given specifications. In other words,
                  for a given input does it generate the correct output?</li>
                <li>There must be opening documentation at the top of each file listing:
                  <ul>
                    <li>your name</li>
                    <li>your student number</li>
                    <li>your lab section (L1A, L1B, etc.)</li>
                    <li>the date</li>
                    <li>a brief description of what the program does, what is required as input, and what is generated as output</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There must be comments inserted into the code to document any programmer-defined functions (introduced in week 6)
                  and to document logic that might otherwise be hard to figure out.</li>
                <li>Whitespace must be used appropriately and consistently.
                  Pay attention to spaces between operators, to the use of blank
                  lines to make logical separations in your code, and to the
                  use of indentation.</li>
                <li>Identifiers must be descriptive. </li>
                <li>Code must be concise but readable. Don't make it so short
                  as to be cryptic, and don't do in 100 lines what could be done in 10!</li>
              </ul>
