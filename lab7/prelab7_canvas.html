    <h3>Learning Goals:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>To write a C program that uses switches and LED displays of the DAQ module (data acquisition, I/O)</li>
      <li>To implement a simple counter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
      You will write a program that implements a simple counter, and
      displays the counter value on an LED screen. Note that we are
      using the term <b>LED screen</b> to refer to a number of 7-segment
      LED displays arranged in a row.

    Note the following in order to complete this pre-lab for Lab 7.
    <ul>
      <li>to develop and test your program, you will need to install
        and use the simulator that has been provided to you.</li>
      <li>to write your program, start from the
        <strong>DAQ_general_framework</strong>, then add the required new function(s).</li>
      <li>Refer to the DAQ functions syntax sheet to read (or write) from (to) an input (output) device.</li>
      <li>The function <code>writeNumber()</code> (and of course <code>writeDigit()</code>) will be provided to you as a
        <strong>.c</strong> file in the lab. A sample <code>main()</code> function (from the general framework) and the
        prototype
        of all DAQ functions will be also provided to you.</li>
      <li>Please make every effort to write your own program first. Only use the sample solution if you need help to
        improve or find bugs in your own program. Note that this is only one possible solution... there are many others.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <p>
      As usual, the <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">in-lab
        exercise</span> will be described in a print-out that the TAs
      will give you at the beginning of the lab.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The program will be identical for both the simulator and
        the hardware. For the in-lab exercise of this lab, you will
        be using the physical hardware device, not the simulator.</li>
      <li>You are allowed (and encouraged) to have your textbook with you.</li>
      <li>Obviously, as before you <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">are
          NOT allowed</span> to use the sample solution, prelab info on
        Canvas or any other unpermitted reference materials during the lab.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lab Preparation:</h3>

    In preparation for this lab you may find it useful to review:
    <ul>
      <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">relevant lecture
          notes (such as on the Display, Digital IO and Sleep()) and
          class activities</span>.</li>

      <div class="tabpage" id="lab_tabpage_1">

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

        <p>
          You are given a system that consists of 8 7-segment LED displays
          and two toggle switches. The 8 LED displays are arranged in a row
          and will be called an LED screen.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are to <span style="color:red;">write a program in C</span>
          that implements a simple counter and displays the counter value
          on the LED screen. The counter simply counts the number of elapsed
          seconds (similar to a digital stop-watch). The switches control
          the operation of the counter.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The two switches are connected to
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">digital input channels
              numbered 0 to 1</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Switch #0 is connected to channel #0, and is called the
                <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">RUN switch</span>.</li>
              <li>Switch #1 is connected to channel #1 and is called the
                <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">RESET switch</span>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The LED screen consists of 8 LED displays. The first display
            on the right is at position #0 and the last display on the left
            is at position #7.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        Your program should operate as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>When the program first starts, it should
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prompt the user</span>
            for the start and stop values of the counter.</li>
          <li> The program should
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">then verify that</span>
            both switches are off, and not do anything else until the two
            switches are indeed off.</li>
          <li>Next the program should
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">set the initial value</span>
            of the counter to the start value previously entered by the user
            and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">show</span> this
            value on the LED screen.</li>
          <li> While both switches are off, the counter should display
            the current value, whatever it happens to be.</li>
          <li>If the RESET switch is off and the RUN switch is on, then
            the counter should increment its value once a second and
            show it on the LED screen.</li>
          <li>When the counter reaches the stop value previously entered
            by the user, it should stop counting, but continue to display
            this final value on the LED screen. </li>
          <li>If the RESET switch is on, then it doesn't matter whether the RUN switch is on or off. The value of the
            counter is reset to the start value and shown on the LED screen. The counter remains at the start value
            while the RESET switch
            is on. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Simulator</h3>
        <p>
          The simulator will allow you to test your program without the
          need for actual physical hardware. To access the configuration
          for this problem, <span style="color:red;">you should specify a
            <code>setupNum</code> with value 4</span> when calling the
          <code>setupDAQ</code> function. <strong>You will find the
            simulator on Canvas.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>All Lab computers already have the simulator installed.</p>

        <p>For the in-lab exercise of this lab, you will be using the actual
          hardware device. The device will also have 2 switches and 8
          seven-segment LED displays arranged in a row as an LED screen.
        </p>

      <div class="tabpage" id="lab_tabpage_2">

        <h3>Algorithm development and coding</h3>

        <p>
          Carefully read the <strong>Problem Statement</strong> and
          try to decompose the problem into smaller manageable parts.
          Consider the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a new project in Visual Studio to implement your
            program in programming language C. <strong>You must create a project
              of type <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 153);">APSC160 - DAQ</span>,
              otherwise Visual Studio will not be able to find the DAQ header
              or simulator files.</strong> Also note that the extension
            of your source file must be .c (not cpp)</li>
          <li>You can use the <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 153);">DAQ general
              framework</span> as a starting point. The framework includes
            the main function and a work function (that you should rename
            to be more descriptive). You must call the two DAQ library functions
            <code>setupDAQ(...)</code> and <code>continueSuperLoop()</code>.
          </li>
          <li>Define the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">symbolic
              constants</span> that you need for your program.</li>
          <li>You now may include the required statements that would
            allow you to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">read from
              the two switches</span>. You also need to think about where
            in your program you are going to include these statements.
            Refer to the course notes for information on how to access
            the functions provided by the DAQ library.</li>
          <li>It is a good idea to compile your code regularly and
            remove any syntax errors as you proceed.</li>
          <li>The <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">writeNumber(...)
              function</span> is also provided to you. This is the function
            that you can use to write a non-negative integer number to
            the eight 7-segment displays of the hardware module
            (discussed thoroughly in class)</li>
          <li>Now you need to <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">devise an
              algorithm</span> that will implement the counting functionality
            that is outlined in the problem statement.
            You can do so either by using a flow-chart or an itemized list
            in plain language.</li>
        </ol>
        <br />

        Do not attempt to code your entire solution in the <code>main(...)</code> function.
        Your program should include at least the following two functions:
        <ul>
          <li><span style="color:red;"><code>runCounter</code></span>: this function
            should implement all of the logic of the counter, and continue looping
            until the user decides to quit. </li>
          <li><span style="color:red;"><code>writeNumber</code></span>: this function
            writes the given non-negative integer number to the LED screen. The least
            significant digit of the number should be shown on the right-most display
            (i.e. position #0). You can assume that the number will fit within the 8
            digits of the LED screen.
            (Hint: think about how decimal numbers are converted to binary numbers.
            You may find the modulos operator (%) useful)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>
          If you are having difficulty using, understanding, or implementing the
          <code>writeNumber</code> function, then you may want to refer to the function
          that is posted as part of the notes on LED Displays. Of course, you can
          also refer to the provided sample solution as a last resort.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="color:red;">Important</span>: as mentioned earlier,
          for the in-lab exercise, you will not be expected to implement a
          function similar to <code>writeNumber(..)</code>. Instead you will
          be given the source for the <code>writeNumber(...)</code> function and
          any support functions that it calls. You will be allowed to copy
          this function into your code.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tabpage" id="lab_tabpage_3">

        <h3>Developing a test suite</h3>

        <p>
          You should think about how to develop a test suite that can be
          used to test your program once it is written. Refer to the
          notes in earlier labs on how to choose appropriate test values.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having chosen your test values, determine the expected output.
          Some of the expected outputs may simply be a description of what
          is happening, rather than a specific number, e.g. the counter
          is running, the counter is stopped, etc. After you have written
          your program, you can then test your program with each of your
          test values and check that your program produces the expected
          result. If it doesn't, you probably have one or more logic
          errors in your code.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Testing</span>: once
            your code has successfully compiled, verify that it produces
            correct results using the test suite that you developed earlier.
            If any of your tests fails, you must look for logic errors
            in your algorithm.
          </li>
          <li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Debugging</span>: now
            that the programs that you are writing are becoming a little
            more complex, you might find it useful to use the debugger
            that is integrated into the Visual Studio environment.
          </li>

        <h3>Sample Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Use the sample solution to help you to find bugs in your own
          program. Note that the sample solution is not the only solution.
