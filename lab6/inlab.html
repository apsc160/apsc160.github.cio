              <h3>Learning Goals:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>To gain experience making laboratory measurements using the hardware module.</li>
                <li>To calibrate the device, computing important characterstic information using spreadsheet software</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Summary:</h3>
              <p>
                In this in-lab component, you will use the hardware module to take measurements and collect data
                to be used for calibration of the 2D digitizer, as well as for digitally reproducing images traced
                by the tip of the jointed arm.
              </p>

              <h3>Part 1:</h3>
              <p>
                In the first part of the lab, you will take some measurements using the two-part arm. With the aid of a program that will be given to you,
                you will measure and record the angle of the arms, and the corresponding voltage value of the sensors in the arm.
                To do this, you will need a protractor and ruler.  The purpose is to determine a relationship between angle and voltage,
                so you can use this information to work backwards: given a set of voltages, determine the angles of the joints, and hence position of the
                arm tip.  It is very important to take care with this part, since if the relationship is incorrect, you will not be able
                to complete Part 2.
              </p>

              <h3>Part 2:</h3>
              <p>
                In part two, you will be required to trace some figures using the arm, and collect voltage readings from the two sensors.
                You will be given a program that will read the voltages (in millivolts) and store these values into a file.  You will
                need these files for the at-home portion of the lab.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note that you will NOT need to write any code, or compile any programs. All programs that you are required to use will
                be given to you as an executable.
              </p>

              <h3>Problem Decomposition:</h3>

              Here is the list of the steps that you will need to take for this part of the lab:
              <ol>
                <li>Understanding the problem</li>
                <li>Determining data that needs to be measured</li>
                <li><strong>Performing the measurement</strong> using a provided
                  program (<code>sensorReader</code>)</li>
                <li>Creating the excel file for computing the relationship between voltage and angles</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>1. Description of the Problem:</h3>
              <p>
                The two-part arm on the hardware module contains two sensors - one at the <strong>base</strong>, where the arm is connected to the
                module, and one at the <strong>elbow</strong> where the two parts of the arm are connected.  The two sensors are simply
                rotary potentiometers at the base and elbow of the arm that measure a voltage which changes as the knobs are
                rotated. The sensor values are the voltages read from the potentiometers, measured in millivolts.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using the values read from the sensors, a program can determine the position of the two parts of the arm,
                as well as the tracing end-point of the arm.  For a program to be able to effectively determine the
                positions, the relationship between the angle of the arms and the associated voltage must be determined.
                We will call this process <em>calibrating the sensors</em>.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Measurements:</h3>

              To calibrate the arm sensors, a series of data measurements must be taken. Each data measurement involves moving the
              arm to a new position, and recording the following information simultaneously:
              <ul>
                <li>angle of base (using a protractor)</li>
                <li>voltage value of base sensor (from the display)</li>
                <li>angle of elbow (using the protractor)</li>
                <li>voltage value of elbow sensor (from the display)</li>
              </ul>
              The full range of motion of each joint of the arm should be considered when
              selecting measurement configurations.

              <p>
                In addition, you should measure the length of the two parts of the arm and record this information.
                Note that this is the <strong>effective length</strong> of each arm section, which should be measured from joint-centre to
                joint-centre, not edge to edge.
              </p>

              <p>
                The following diagram and description defines various terms and explains how to measure the angles.
                <strong>Positive angles are measured in the <span class="highlight">counter-clockwise</span> direction</strong> and negative angles are
                measured in the clockwise direction. You should record all your angle measurements in degrees.
                You may also find it useful to refer to Lab 1.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>base segment</strong>: the segment from point A to point B (this is the length of the base segment of the arm).
                  Note that point A and Point B are where the base sensor and elbow sensor are connected to the segment, respectively.</li>
                <li><strong>elbow segment</strong>: the segment from point B to point C (this is the length of the elbow segment of the arm).
                  Note that point B and point C are where the elbow sensor is connected to the segment and the tip of the arm, respectively.</li>
                <li><strong>base angle</strong>: this is θ<sub>1</sub> in the diagram. It is the angle from the x-axis to the base segment. </li>
                <li><strong>absolute elbow angle</strong>: this is θ<sub>2</sub> in the diagram. Assume that the origin of the x and
                  y axis is at point B. The absolute elbow angle is then the angle from the x-axis to the elbow segment. </li>
                <li><strong>relative elbow angle</strong>: this is θ<sub>3</sub> in the diagram. It is the angle from the base segment to the elbow segment.</li>
                <li><strong>base sensor</strong>: the sensor located at point A. </li>
                <li><strong>elbow sensor</strong>: the sensor located at point B. </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>Double and triple-check your understanding of the angles and directions of measurement.</strong>  The most common mistake
                in this lab is to measure the wrong angles, leading to nonsensical voltage-angle relationships.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Making Measurements using <strong>sensorReader</strong></h3>

              <p>
                In order to display the voltages associated with each sensor, you should use the <strong>sensorReader</strong> program.
                This program reads the voltage values of the two sensors and displays
                these values on the numeric display of the hardware module.
                The voltage for the <span style="color: red;">base sensor</span> is displayed on <span style="color: red;">left-most 4 digits</span>, and the
                voltage for the elbow sensor is displayed on the right-most 4 digits. Note that the voltages are shown in <span style="color: red;">millivolts</span>.
                For more information about this program, refer to the "Using the sensorReader Program" section below.
              </p>

              You must determine the positions that you are going to move the arm to, when taking the measurements.
              For each new position you choose, it is better to move the arm in a manner that as a result both of its segments move.
              As you move the arm, the angles at the base and elbow will change, and as a result the voltage values of the sensors
              will also change. Each new position of the arm corresponds to one data measurement. Keep in mind the following:
              <ul>
                <li>Each sensor has two physical boundary conditions, which occur when you rotate the sensor all the way clockwise
                  or counterclockwise. These will give you two data measurements per sensor.</li>
                <li>You should have several additional unique data measurements per sensor.</li>
                <li>For the elbow angle, you should be measuring the <span style="color: red;">relative elbow angle</span>.
                  You do not need to measure the absolute elbow angle, since it is relatively straightforward to convert between the
                  relative and absolute angles.</li>
                <li>For the base angle, all your recorded angles should be in the <span style="color: red;">range -180 degrees to +180 degrees</span>. </li>
                <li>For the elbow angle, all your recorded angles should be in the <span style="color: red;">range 0 degrees to 360 degrees</span>. </li>
              </ul>
              It is recommended to take as many measurements as required to ensure there is a distinct trend in the data.
              A <em>minimum</em> of 5 unique measurements for each sensor must be recorded.

              <h3>Using the sensorReader Program</h3>

              <p>
                In the lab, the <strong>sensorReader</strong> program is available on the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Z: drive</span>, in
                the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SensorReader</span> folder.
              </p>

              <p>
                To use the <strong>sensorReader</strong> program, simply double-click on the program to
                start it, and follow the instructions. The program will open two
                command line windows with some information.  Leave them open until you are done with the measurements.
                The program will display <span style="color: red;">the base sensor voltage on the left-most four digits</span>
                of the numeric display and <span style="color: red;">the elbow sensor voltage on the right-most four digits</span>
                of the numeric display of the hardware module.
                The maximum value is usually between 4000 and 5000 millivolts, depending on the particular hardware module.
              </p>

              <p>
                If the numeric display shows "E" (error), you are getting a negative and invalid voltage because you rotated
                the sensor too far in one direction. Rotate that sensor in the other direction, until you get a valid number.
              </p>

              <p>
                Also note that the hardware module latched the numbers on the display, so when you exit the <strong>sensorReader</strong>
                program the last number displayed will still be shown on the displays until you run another program or disconnect it from power.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Excel Data File</h3>

              When you are making your data measurements, you will have a table containing the following information for each data
              measurement:
              <ul>
                <li>voltage value of base sensor </li>
                <li>base angle </li>
                <li>voltage value of elbow sensor </li>
                <li>relative elbow angle</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>4a) Creating an Excel file and calibrating your data</h3>
              <p>
                You should put all the information of the above table into an <span style="color: red;">Excel</span> file.
                This table should have four columns, one column for each of the data items listed above.
                Label each column using a short descriptive name, such as "Base voltage (mv)". The number of rows of this table
                will be determined by the number of data measurements you made. The angles should be given in degrees.
              </p>

              <h3>4b) Plotting the Angle-Voltage Relationship using Excel</h3>
              <p>
                You are also required to draw two <span style="color: red;">X-Y plots</span> using the scatter chart type of
                Excel: one plot is for the base sensor, and the other plot is for the elbow sensor.
                Use the same Excel worksheet that you used in part 4a above also for plotting these two
                figures. <strong>The voltage values should be on the x axis and the angle values on the y
                axis</strong> of each plot. Add a <span style="color: red;">trendline</span> to each figure and choose "<span style="color: red;">display
                equation on chart</span>". Properly label the figures and axes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once you have done all of the above, you should have a single Excel file
                containing your voltage and angle measurement data, and two plots of
                your data: one plot for the base sensor and one plot for the elbow
                sensor. You will submit this file as a part of your deliverables.
                <strong>Ensure that you can see an obvious relationship</strong> between
                angle and voltage for both sensors, and justify to yourself that the trends
                make sense.  You should show the figure to your TA if you are not sure if
                your plots are acceptable.
              </p>

              In addition to the table described above, you must also include the following
              information at the top of your Excel data file:
              <ul>
                <li>your information (name, student number, lab section)</li>
                <li>the length of the two parts of the arm (in cm)</li>
                <li>your hardware module number.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="tabpage" id="tabpage_3">
              <h3>Problem Decomposition:</h3>

              Here is the list of the steps you need to take for this part of the lab:
              <ol>
                <li>Understanding the problem</li>
                <li><strong>Performing data measurements by tracing a figure</strong>
                  and using a provided program (<strong>saveData</strong>) to save
                  the voltages</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>1. Description of the Problem:</h3>
              <p>
                In this part of the lab, you will be required to trace a figure
                using the two-part arm, and collect the voltage readings from the
                two sensors.
              </p>

              <p>
                Again, you are going to use these measurements in the At-Home part
                of the lab, <span class="highlight">so please make the measurements
                carefully</span>.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Tracing the Figure</h3>
              <p>
                You will be given one figure in the lab session and will be required
                to trace the figure using the two part arm. Specifically, you should
                use the end-point on the arm to follow the path of the figure, returning
                back to your starting point. When tracing the figure you should not move
                the end-point too quickly, and be careful not to move the figure itself,
                as this will reduce the quality of your data.
              </p>

              <p>
                While you are tracing the figure, you will use the <strong>saveData</strong>
                program to save the data from the two sensors of the arm into a file.
                Refer to the section "Notes on Using the saveData Program" for more information
                about this program.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your data may turn out not to be accurate.
                To protect against this, repeat the figure tracing procedure a second time, but
                in a different method.  For instance, you may decide to trace the figure once
                clockwise and the next counter-clockwise; and/or start from a different point
                on the figure.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once you have completed tracing the figure, you should have two data files.
              </p>

              <h3>Notes on Using the saveData Program</h3>
              <p>
                In the lab, the <strong>saveData</strong> program is available on the
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Z: drive</span>, in
                the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SaveData</span> folder. Before using the
                program, <span class="highlight">copy the
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SaveData folder</span> to your
                work folder on D: drive</span>, since the program will be writing to
                files. To use the program simply double-click on it, and follow the instructions.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: The <strong>saveData</strong>
                program cannot be used at the same time as the <strong>sensorReader</strong>
                program from Part 1. Ensure that only one of these two programs is running
                at any given time.
              </p>

              <p>
                The <strong>saveData</strong> program is used to read the base and elbow
                sensors and store the voltage values into a data file. The data file is a
                tab-delimited text file, which by default will be created in the same folder as
                the program. The voltage values will be stored in
                <span style="color: red;">millivolts</span>. The <span style="color: red;">first column</span>
                corresponds to the base sensor voltage and the <span style="color: red;">second column</span>
                to the elbow sensor voltage.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you run the program, it will open two command-line windows. On one of the windows,
                it will prompt you for the name of the data file. It will not let you overwrite an existing file,
                so if you enter the name of an existing file, the program will print an error and ask
                for a new name. After you have entered the data file name, the program will start reading
                the sensor data right away, and write it to the file as well as to the console window.
                <strong>So it is a good idea to keep the tip of the two-part arm at one of the corners of the
                  figure you plan to trace before you run the program.</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                The <strong>saveData</strong> program also displays the values on the display for your
                convenience. Make sure you do not see an "E" on the display (meaning error or invalid
                values) or correspondigly negative values on the monitor, while you are tracing the figure.
                If you do see an "E", that means that you are moving the arm too far in one direction and are
                in an invalid region.  You will have to move the figure and restart the tracing procedure.
              </p>

              <p>
                When you have finished tracing the figure, quit the DAQ program by pressing Enter in the
                second window. This will ensure that the program is properly terminated and
                that no data is lost.

              <h3>Submission Instructions:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Unlike previous labs, you will not be submitting
                  any programs for this lab.</li>
                <li>Instead you will be submitting a number of data files.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Files to Upload/Submit</h3>

              You must submit the following three data files before the end of your lap period:
              <ul>
                <li>Your Excel data file from part 1 containing your
                  angle and voltage measurements and two plots.
                  Don't forget to also include in the data file: the length
                  of the two segments that you measured, your information (name ...),
                  and the number of your hardware module. </li>
                <li>The two data files from part 2 generated by the
                  <strong>saveData</strong> program for the figure.</li>
              </ul>
              <br/>

              To submit the files,
              <ul>
                <li>Open the File Explorer on your Windows computer. From My Computer, gather the three files into a common folder.</li>
                <li>Select the three files, right click on them and select Send to / Compressed (zipped) folder. Follow the prompts to generate a ZIP file in the same directory.</li>
                <li>Go to <a href="https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~apsc160/handin/" target="_blank">https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~apsc160/handin/</a>.</li>
                <li>Click on <strong>Start handin</strong>. Login with your undergrad account and password.</li>
                <li>Select "Lab 6 - in lab" from the list of assignments. Then click on <strong>"Choose File"</strong> or <strong>"Browse..."</strong>,
                  and select the ZIP file you created in the previous steps.</li>
                <li>If you previously handed in a file for the current lab, check the "Override a previous submission" option, otherwise keep it unchecked. Then click on <strong>"Handin assignment"</strong>.
                  When presented with a confirmation dialog, read it and accept it.</li>
                <li>Read the result of the handin submission, and show it to a TA. If it lists an error, the TA may be able to help you correct the error.</li>
                <li>Once you have submitted the file, click on <strong>"Start handin"</strong> again, select <strong>"Lab 6 - in lab"</strong> and click on <strong>"Check submissions"</strong>.
                  In the resulting page, check that all three files you submitted are listed.</li>
              </ul>

              <strong>Do not</strong> attempt to keep a copy of the work that you have submitted.  The files will be returned to you by the end of the week for
              you to begin the at-home portion.
