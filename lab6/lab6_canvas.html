				<h3>Learning Goals:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>To gain experience making laboratory measurements using the hardware module.</li>
					<li>To calibrate the device, computing important characterstic information using spreadsheet
						software</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Summary:</h3>
				<p>
					In this in-lab component, you will use the hardware module to take measurements and collect data
					to be used for calibration of the 2D digitizer, as well as for digitally reproducing images traced
					by the tip of the jointed arm.
				</p>

				<h3>Part 1:</h3>
				<p>
					In the first part of the lab, you will take some measurements using the two-part arm. With the aid
					of a program that will be given to you,
					you will measure and record the angle of the arms, and the corresponding voltage value of the
					sensors in the arm.
					To do this, you will need a protractor and ruler. The purpose is to determine a relationship between
					angle and voltage,
					so you can use this information to work backwards: given a set of voltages, determine the angles of
					the joints, and hence position of the
					arm tip. It is very important to take care with this part, since if the relationship is incorrect,
					you will not be able
					to complete Part 2.
				</p>

				<h3>Part 2:</h3>
				<p>
					In part two, you will be required to trace some figures using the arm, and collect voltage readings
					from the two sensors.
					You will be given a program that will read the voltages (in millivolts) and store these values into
					a file. You will
					need these files for the at-home portion of the lab.
				</p>

				<p>
					Note that you will NOT need to write any code, or compile any programs. All programs that you are
					required to use will
					be given to you as an executable.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="tabpage" id="lab_tabpage_2">
				<h3>Problem Decomposition:</h3>

				Here is the list of the steps that you will need to take for this part of the lab:
				<ol>
					<li>Understanding the problem</li>
					<li>Determining data that needs to be measured</li>
					<li><strong>Performing the measurement</strong> using a provided
						program (<code>sensorReader</code>)</li>
					<li>Creating the excel file for computing the relationship between voltage and angles</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>1. Description of the Problem:</h3>
				<p>
					The two-part arm on the hardware module contains two sensors - one at the <strong>base</strong>,
					where the arm is connected to the
					module, and one at the <strong>elbow</strong> where the two parts of the arm are connected. The two
					sensors are simply
					rotary potentiometers at the base and elbow of the arm that measure a voltage which changes as the
					knobs are
					rotated. The sensor values are the voltages read from the potentiometers, measured in millivolts.
				</p>
				<p>
					By using the values read from the sensors, a program can determine the position of the two parts of
					the arm,
					as well as the tracing end-point of the arm. For a program to be able to effectively determine the
					positions, the relationship between the angle of the arms and the associated voltage must be
					determined.
					We will call this process <em>calibrating the sensors</em>.
				</p>

				<h3>2. Measurements:</h3>

				To calibrate the arm sensors, a series of data measurements must be taken. Each data measurement
				involves moving the
				arm to a new position, and recording the following information simultaneously:
				<ul>
					<li>angle of base (using a protractor)</li>
					<li>voltage value of base sensor (from the display)</li>
					<li>angle of elbow (using the protractor)</li>
					<li>voltage value of elbow sensor (from the display)</li>
				</ul>
				The full range of motion of each joint of the arm should be considered when
				selecting measurement configurations.

				<p>
					In addition, you should measure the length of the two parts of the arm and record this information.
					Note that this is the <strong>effective length</strong> of each arm section, which should be
					measured from joint-centre to
					joint-centre, not edge to edge.
				</p>

				<p>
					The following diagram and description defines various terms and explains how to measure the angles.
					<strong>Positive angles are measured in the <span class="highlight" style="color: crimson; font-weight: bold;">counter-clockwise</span>
						direction</strong> and negative angles are
					measured in the clockwise direction. You should record all your angle measurements in degrees.
					You may also find it useful to refer to Lab 1.
				</p>

				<img class="figure" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" style="border: 2px;" alt="DAQ arm"
					src="https://apsc160.github.io/lab6/images/two_part_arm.gif" />

				<ul>
					<li><strong>base segment</strong>: the segment from point A to point B (this is the length of the
						base segment of the arm).
						Note that point A and Point B are where the base sensor and elbow sensor are connected to the
						segment, respectively.</li>
					<li><strong>elbow segment</strong>: the segment from point B to point C (this is the length of the
						elbow segment of the arm).
						Note that point B and point C are where the elbow sensor is connected to the segment and the tip
						of the arm, respectively.</li>
					<li><strong>base angle</strong>: this is θ<sub>1</sub> in the diagram. It is the angle from the
						x-axis to the base segment. </li>
					<li><strong>absolute elbow angle</strong>: this is θ<sub>2</sub> in the diagram. Assume that the
						origin of the x and
						y axis is at point B. The absolute elbow angle is then the angle from the x-axis to the elbow
						segment. </li>
					<li><strong>relative elbow angle</strong>: this is θ<sub>3</sub> in the diagram. It is the angle
						from the base segment to the elbow segment.</li>
					<li><strong>base sensor</strong>: the sensor located at point A. </li>
					<li><strong>elbow sensor</strong>: the sensor located at point B. </li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					<strong>Double and triple-check your understanding of the angles and directions of
						measurement.</strong> The most common mistake
					in this lab is to measure the wrong angles, leading to nonsensical voltage-angle relationships.
				</p>

				<h3>3. Making Measurements using <strong>sensorReader</strong></h3>

				<p>
					In order to display the voltages associated with each sensor, you should use the
					<strong>sensorReader</strong> program.
					This program reads the voltage values of the two sensors and displays
					these values on the numeric display of the hardware module.
					The voltage for the <span style="color: red;">base sensor</span> is displayed on <span
						style="color: red;">left-most 4 digits</span>, and the
					voltage for the elbow sensor is displayed on the right-most 4 digits. Note that the voltages are
					shown in <span style="color: red;">millivolts</span>.
					For more information about this program, refer to the "Using the sensorReader Program" section
					below.
				</p>

				You must determine the positions that you are going to move the arm to, when taking the measurements.
				For each new position you choose, it is better to move the arm in a manner that as a result both of its
				segments move.
				As you move the arm, the angles at the base and elbow will change, and as a result the voltage values of
				the sensors
				will also change. Each new position of the arm corresponds to one data measurement. Keep in mind the
				following:
				<ul>
					<li>Each sensor has two physical boundary conditions, which occur when you rotate the sensor all the
						way clockwise
						or counterclockwise. These will give you two data measurements per sensor.</li>
					<li>You should have several additional unique data measurements per sensor.</li>
					<li>For the elbow angle, you should be measuring the <span style="color: red;">relative elbow
							angle</span>.
						You do not need to measure the absolute elbow angle, since it is relatively straightforward to
						convert between the
						relative and absolute angles.</li>
					<li>For the base angle, all your recorded angles should be in the <span style="color: red;">range
							-180 degrees to +180 degrees</span>. </li>
					<li>For the elbow angle, all your recorded angles should be in the <span style="color: red;">range 0
							degrees to 360 degrees</span>. </li>
				</ul>
				It is recommended to take as many measurements as required to ensure there is a distinct trend in the
				data.
				A <em>minimum</em> of 5 unique measurements for each sensor must be recorded.

				<h3>Using the sensorReader Program</h3>

				<p>
					In the lab, the <strong>sensorReader</strong> program is available on the <span
						style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Z: drive</span>, in
					the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SensorReader</span> folder.
				</p>

				<p>
					To use the <strong>sensorReader</strong> program, simply double-click on the program to
					start it, and follow the instructions. The program will open two
					command line windows with some information. Leave them open until you are done with the
					measurements.
					The program will display <span style="color: red;">the base sensor voltage on the left-most four
						digits</span>
					of the numeric display and <span style="color: red;">the elbow sensor voltage on the right-most four
						digits</span>
					of the numeric display of the hardware module.
					The maximum value is usually between 4000 and 5000 millivolts, depending on the particular hardware
					module.
				</p>

				<p>
					If the numeric display shows "E" (error), you are getting a negative and invalid voltage because you
					rotated
					the sensor too far in one direction. Rotate that sensor in the other direction, until you get a
					valid number.
				</p>

				<p>
					Also note that the hardware module latched the numbers on the display, so when you exit the
					<strong>sensorReader</strong>
					program the last number displayed will still be shown on the displays until you run another program
					or disconnect it from power.
				</p>

				<h3>4. Excel Data File</h3>

				When you are making your data measurements, you will have a table containing the following information
				for each data
				measurement:
				<ul>
					<li>voltage value of base sensor </li>
					<li>base angle </li>
					<li>voltage value of elbow sensor </li>
					<li>relative elbow angle</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>4a) Creating an Excel file and calibrating your data</h3>
				<p>
					You should put all the information of the above table into an <span style="color: red;">Excel</span>
					file.
					This table should have four columns, one column for each of the data items listed above.
					Label each column using a short descriptive name, such as "Base voltage (mv)". The number of rows of
					this table
					will be determined by the number of data measurements you made. The angles should be given in
					degrees.
				</p>

				<h3>4b) Plotting the Angle-Voltage Relationship using Excel</h3>
				<p>
					You are also required to draw two <span style="color: red;">X-Y plots</span> using the scatter chart
					type of
					Excel: one plot is for the base sensor, and the other plot is for the elbow sensor.
					Use the same Excel worksheet that you used in part 4a above also for plotting these two
					figures. <strong>The voltage values should be on the x axis and the angle values on the y
						axis</strong> of each plot. Add a <span style="color: red;">trendline</span> to each figure and
					choose "<span style="color: red;">display
						equation on chart</span>". Properly label the figures and axes.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once you have done all of the above, you should have a single Excel file
					containing your voltage and angle measurement data, and two plots of
					your data: one plot for the base sensor and one plot for the elbow
					sensor. You will submit this file as a part of your deliverables.
					<strong>Ensure that you can see an obvious relationship</strong> between
					angle and voltage for both sensors, and justify to yourself that the trends
					make sense. You should show the figure to your TA if you are not sure if
					your plots are acceptable.
				</p>

				In addition to the table described above, you must also include the following
				information at the top of your Excel data file:
				<ul>
					<li>your information (name, student number, lab section)</li>
					<li>the length of the two parts of the arm (in cm)</li>
					<li>your hardware module number.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="tabpage" id="lab_tabpage_3">
				<h3>Problem Decomposition:</h3>

				Here is the list of the steps you need to take for this part of the lab:
				<ol>
					<li>Understanding the problem</li>
					<li><strong>Performing data measurements by tracing a figure</strong>
						and using a provided program (<strong>saveData</strong>) to save
						the voltages</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>1. Description of the Problem:</h3>
				<p>
					In this part of the lab, you will be required to trace a figure
					using the two-part arm, and collect the voltage readings from the
					two sensors.
				</p>

				<p>
					Again, you are going to use these measurements in the At-Home part
					of the lab, <span class="highlight" style="color: crimson; font-weight: bold;">so please make the measurements
						carefully</span>.
				</p>

				<h3>2. Tracing the Figure</h3>
				<p>
					You will be given one figure in the lab session and will be required
					to trace the figure using the two part arm. Specifically, you should
					use the end-point on the arm to follow the path of the figure, returning
					back to your starting point. When tracing the figure you should not move
					the end-point too quickly, and be careful not to move the figure itself,
					as this will reduce the quality of your data.
				</p>

				<p>
					While you are tracing the figure, you will use the <strong>saveData</strong>
					program to save the data from the two sensors of the arm into a file.
					Refer to the section "Notes on Using the saveData Program" for more information
					about this program.
				</p>

				<p>
					Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your data may turn out not to be accurate.
					To protect against this, repeat the figure tracing procedure a second time, but
					in a different method. For instance, you may decide to trace the figure once
					clockwise and the next counter-clockwise; and/or start from a different point
					on the figure.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once you have completed tracing the figure, you should have two data files.
				</p>

				<h3>Notes on Using the saveData Program</h3>
				<p>
					In the lab, the <strong>saveData</strong> program is available on the
					<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Z: drive</span>, in
					the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SaveData</span> folder. Before using the
					program, <span class="highlight" style="color: crimson; font-weight: bold;">copy the
						<span style="text-decoration: underline;">SaveData folder</span> to your
						work folder on D: drive</span>, since the program will be writing to
					files. To use the program simply double-click on it, and follow the instructions.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span>: The <strong>saveData</strong>
					program cannot be used at the same time as the <strong>sensorReader</strong>
					program from Part 1. Ensure that only one of these two programs is running
					at any given time.
				</p>

				<p>
					The <strong>saveData</strong> program is used to read the base and elbow
					sensors and store the voltage values into a data file. The data file is a
					tab-delimited text file, which by default will be created in the same folder as
					the program. The voltage values will be stored in
					<span style="color: red;">millivolts</span>. The <span style="color: red;">first column</span>
					corresponds to the base sensor voltage and the <span style="color: red;">second column</span>
					to the elbow sensor voltage.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you run the program, it will open two command-line windows. On one of the windows,
					it will prompt you for the name of the data file. It will not let you overwrite an existing file,
					so if you enter the name of an existing file, the program will print an error and ask
					for a new name. After you have entered the data file name, the program will start reading
					the sensor data right away, and write it to the file as well as to the console window.
					<strong>So it is a good idea to keep the tip of the two-part arm at one of the corners of the
						figure you plan to trace before you run the program.</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					The <strong>saveData</strong> program also displays the values on the display for your
					convenience. Make sure you do not see an "E" on the display (meaning error or invalid
					values) or correspondigly negative values on the monitor, while you are tracing the figure.
					If you do see an "E", that means that you are moving the arm too far in one direction and are
					in an invalid region. You will have to move the figure and restart the tracing procedure.
				</p>

				<p>
					When you have finished tracing the figure, quit the DAQ program by pressing Enter in the
					second window. This will ensure that the program is properly terminated and
					that no data is lost.

			<div class="tabpage" id="home_tabpage_2">
				<h3>Description of the Problem</h3>

				<p>
					In the in-lab component, part 2, you generated two data files
					(two traces) using the hardware module. In this part of the lab, you
					will use Excel to generate plots of this data. You should create one Excel
					file containing two Excel worksheets, one for each of the data
					files that you generated.<br /><br />
				</p>

				<h3>1. Calculating X &amp; Y Coordinates</h3>

				To plot your data, you will need to determine the X &amp; Y coordinates
				of the end-point of the arm. In your data files from In-Lab Part 2, you
				have the voltage of the base and elbow sensors. The following are the basic
				steps to convert those voltage values into X &amp; Y coordinates:
				<ol>
					<li> Using your results from part 1, convert the voltage values into angles.
						Specifically, use the slope and intercept of the angle vs. voltage plots.
						This calculation will give you the relative angles for both the base sensor
						and the elbow sensor. </li>
					<li> Convert the relative angles to absolute angles. For the base sensor,
						the relative and absolute angles are the same, but for the elbow sensor
						they are different. </li>
					<li> Using the absolute angles, and the lengths of the base and elbow segments,
						determine the values of the X &amp; Y coordinates. This is the same
						calculation that was performed in Lab 1. Recall that you measured and
						recorded the lengths of the segments in the In-Lab Part 1. </li>
				</ol>

				<img class="figure" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="DAQ arm" src="https://apsc160.github.io/lab6/images/two_part_arm.gif" />

				<p>
					Recall that for the arm layout above, with angles measured in
					<span class="highlight" style="color: crimson; font-weight: bold;">radians</span> in a counter-clockwise
					direction.  We can relate the three angles together using parallel-line angle rules, and the position of the
					arm's end-point can be computed using basic trigonometry:
				</p>

				<img class="figure" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="500px" alt="equations" src="https://apsc160.github.io/lab6/images/angle_position_equations.png" />
				<p>
					You can put all of the above calculations into a single equation in excel, or split them
					across several equations. In either case, your Excel file should contain all of the
					equations that you used. Do not just put the final values into your Excel file.
					The TAs must see the expressions used to generate your results.
				</p>

				<h3>2. Generating Plots</h3>
				<p>
					For each of your data files, you should generate a plot of the X &amp; Y coordinates
					of the data (with the points joined by lines). If all your calculations were
					done correctly, then the plot should give you a good approximation of the
					original figure. There may be some rotation or distortion of the figure.
					A certain amount is likely, but you should be able to easily recognize the
					original figures.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="tabpage" id="home_tabpage_3">

				<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

				<p>
					For this lab, you will be required to submit one Excel file containing
					all the calculations and graphs for the at-home portion of the lab.
					The Excel file must have <strong>two worksheets</strong>, one for each of the figure traces.
					Properly label the worksheets and include your student info (name,
					student number, lab section, module # you used) as a note at the top-left
					of the first worksheet.
				</p>
