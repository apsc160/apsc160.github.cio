              <h3>Important Notes:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This section of the lab is different from the
                  previous labs in that:
                  <ul>
                    <li>You are not required to do this lab during your
                      normally scheduled lab time. Instead you will be doing
                      this lab at home, or anywhere else that you have access
                      to Excel (including the lab if you wish).</li>
                    <li>Everybody in all lab sections has the same
                      deadline for this lab, see the course webpage for due date information.
                      You can submit your files anytime after the in-lab portion of the lab.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Although you will not be working in your normally scheduled lab period,
                  <span class="highlight">you are still required to do your own work, and use your own data.</span></li>
                <li>All Excel submissions can be in the ".xls" or ".xlsx" MS Excel formats. If you
                  use any other software other than Excel, save your file in Excel format.</li>
                <li>As usual all submissions must be through regular submission procedures.
                  Absolutely no email submissions are accepted.</li>
                <li>You will be given access your data files from the "Lab 6 - In Lab Submission" assignment.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Learning Objectives:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>to analyze the measured data using Excel or other spreadsheet software</li>
                <li>to graph the results</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Summary:</h3>
              <p>
                The At-Home part of the lab continues the focus on the hardware
                module, and in particular you will be using the data that you
                generated in the In-Lab part.
              </p>

              <p>
                You will be graphing your data from the In-Lab Part 2 using
                Excel. In order to graph your data, you will have to perform some
                calculations in Excel.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before continuing, download your in-lab files from Canvas by navigating
                to the <strong>Lab 6 - In Lab Submission</strong> page and accessing your
                last submission.  <strong>Note:</strong> these files will only be made available
                on Friday evening, after the last section has completed their in-lab portion.

              <h3>Description of the Problem</h3>

              <p>
                In the in-lab component, part 2, you generated two data files
                (two traces) using the hardware module. In this part of the lab, you
                will use Excel to generate plots of this data. You should create one Excel
                file containing two Excel worksheets, one for each of the data
                files that you generated.<br/><br/>
              </p>

              <h3>1. Calculating X &amp; Y Coordinates</h3>

              To plot your data, you will need to determine the X &amp; Y coordinates
              of the end-point of the arm. In your data files from In-Lab Part 2, you
              have the voltage of the base and elbow sensors. The following are the basic
              steps to convert those voltage values into X &amp; Y coordinates:
              <ol>
                <li> Using your results from part 1, convert the voltage values into angles.
                  Specifically, use the slope and intercept of the angle vs. voltage plots.
                  This calculation will give you the relative angles for both the base sensor
                  and the elbow sensor. </li>
                <li> Convert the relative angles to absolute angles. For the base sensor,
                  the relative and absolute angles are the same, but for the elbow sensor
                  they are different. </li>
                <li> Using the absolute angles, and the lengths of the base and elbow segments,
                  determine the values of the X &amp; Y coordinates. This is the same
                  calculation that was performed in Lab 1. Recall that you measured and
                  recorded the lengths of the segments in the In-Lab Part 1. </li>
              </ol>

              <img class="figure" alt="DAQ arm" src="./images/two_part_arm.gif"/>

              <p>
                  Recall that for the arm layout above, with angles measured in
                  <span class="highlight" style="color: crimson; font-weight: bold;">radians</span> in a counter-clockwise
                  direction.  We can relate the three angles together using parallel-line angle rules, and the position of the
                  arm's end-point can be computed using basic trigonometry:
              </p>
							  $$\begin{aligned}
                  \theta_2 & = \theta_1 + \theta_3 - \pi\\
                  x & = AB\cos(\theta_1) + BC\cos(\theta_2)\\
                  y & = AB\sin(\theta_1) + BC\sin(\theta_2)
                \end{aligned}$$
							<p>
                You can put all of the above calculations into a single equation in excel, or split them
                across several equations. In either case, your Excel file should contain all of the
                equations that you used. Do not just put the final values into your Excel file.
                The TAs must see the expressions used to generate your results.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Generating Plots</h3>
              <p>
                For each of your data files, you should generate a plot of the X &amp; Y coordinates
                of the data (with the points joined by lines). If all your calculations were
                done correctly, then the plot should give you a good approximation of the
                original figure. There may be some rotation or distortion of the figure.
                A certain amount is likely, but you should be able to easily recognize the
                original figures.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tabpage" id="tabpage_3">

              <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

              <p>
                For this lab, you will be required to submit one Excel file containing
                all the calculations and graphs for the at-home portion of the lab.
                The Excel file must have <strong>two worksheets</strong>, one for each of the figure traces.
                Properly label the worksheets and include your student info (name,
                student number, lab section, module # you used) as a note at the top-left
                of the first worksheet.
              </p>

              Each Excel worksheet should contain the following:
              <ol>
                <li> The original data that you imported from the data file
                  created by the <strong>saveData</strong> program. </li>
                <li> The calculated X &amp; Y coordinates. This can
                  also include any intermediate calculations that you may have done.</li>
                <li> The plot of your X &amp; Y data. The plot should have proper labels and title. </li>
              </ol>

              <h3>Submitting your Files</h3>
              
              Files are to be submitted on Canvas under the <strong>Lab 6 - At Home Submission</strong> page.
              Upload your single excel file containing the two worksheets.  Note that the deadline is the same
              for all lab sections.  <strong>No late submissions will be accepted.</strong>
