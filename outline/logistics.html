<h3>Required Textbook</h3>
<p>The textbook for this course is:  <em>Programming in C</em>, 4th edition, by Stephen Kochan, Addison-Wesley, 2014.</p>
<p>The previous textbook used for this course, <em>Engineering Problem Solving with C</em>, 4th edition, by Delores Etter 2012, is acceptable in place of the Kochan book.</p>
<p>An earlier edition of either of these two books is also OK, but you are responsible for finding the appropriate part of the book that deals with the topics currently being studied in the lecture.</p>
<p>You can use one of these textbooks as a reference during your lab's programming tests; other books or notes are not allowed. Our recommendation is the Kochan textbook, which is available for purchase at the UBC Bookstore or at the Discount Textbook store just off campus in the University Village (about one block southeast of University Boulevard and Wesbrook Mall, above the Starbucks on Dalhousie Road). The following reading rooms/libraries have a copy of the Etter textbook for short-term: (a) Ike Barber Library Reserve Room (two-hour loan, one copy on order), and (b) Computer Science Reading Room (2nd floor of the ICCS building, beside MacLeod's Electrical Engineering building; two copies on one-day loan).  Note that Ike Barber has extended hours, including weekends.  You may wish to buy your own copy, especially if you plan to do programming after the course ends.</p>
<p>In addition, there's a free package of worksheets: APSC 160: In-Class Worksheets. You can download that package through Connect. Bring the current worksheet to your lectures, since we'll be working on that set.</p>
<h3>Optional zyBooks Text</h3>
<p>An optional, on-line textbook that comes complete with additional exercises is also available. Please see the zyBooks tab for details.</p>
<h3>iClickers</h3>
<p>If you don't already have one for your other courses, you’ll need to get an iClicker device. A new clicker costs about $45, and is available from either the UBC Bookstore or Discount Textbooks. An iClicker allows you to earn marks by answering questions posed by the instructor during class. Questions are delivered on the projection screen in class, and instructors can collect and display the aggregate responses from the class. Please remember to register your clicker on Connect by clicking on the "iClicker Registration" icon on the Connect home page. Bring your clicker to every class!</p>
<h3>Connect</h3>
<p>UBC Connect is an e-learning tool that acts as a repository for course notes, policies, labs, etc.—and provides you with useful tools such as the screencasts (videos), worksheets, practice labs, sample solutions, sample exams (with solutions), and a list of your grades in the course. You will be introduced to Connect in your first lab, but feel free to browse around before then. You should already have a CWL account but if you don’t, you can obtain one free of charge by visiting http://www.cwl.ubc.ca. You'll use this account frequently at UBC, and you'll need it to log on to the lab's computers in CEME 2212.  If you have a laptop with a wireless network card, a CWL account will also provide you with free access to UBC’s wireless network:  we recommend you always connect to the secure wireless network (named ubcsecure) whenever you are on campus.  After you log on to Connect, click on the APSC 160 course link to gain access to the course material. Your grades are viewable only by you and course staff.  Connect is available 24 hours per day, weekends included ... except for possibly short, maintenance outages.  Some of your other courses may also use Connect.</p>
<p>The <em>Current Announcements</em> linked from the Home Page is required reading for this course. You should plan to read it regularly, preferably every day.</p>
<!-- <h3>Piazza</h3>
<p>For the course&#039;s discussion board, we will use a more powerful tool called Piazza, instead of Connect.  You may find that your question was answered by a student in another lecture section, by a TA who is not in your lab section, or even by a different instructor.  If you get stuck on things in the course, first try to answer your own question by using the course resources (e.g., your textbook, screencasts on Connect, sample solutions on Connect).  Then, go to Piazza.  You may find that your question has already been asked by someone, and perhaps has been resolved by someone else.  If it has not been asked, go ahead and post your question;  however, avoid posting code for the in-lab programming tests.  Feel free to respond to others&#039; questions.  This activity is called "peer instruction" and is a great way to build your skills and to help others.</p>-->
<h3>FitBit</h3>
<p>FitBit is designed to provide you with additional practice problems - a link is provided from the Home Page on Connect. The following video provides a useful introduction to using this tool effectively: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG_777GdJLU" target="_blank">Introduction to FitBit</a></p>

<p>The instructor reserves the right to modify this grading scheme during the term as necessary.</p>
<p>Note 1: We’ll start using the clickers for marks during your second class. <em>Anyone found responding to clicker questions on behalf of another student will receive a grade of zero for the clicker portion of the course.</em> If you wish to earn these marks, you must attend the whole class and participate. For each clicker question, half the marks will be for participation and half will be awarded for the correct answer. To allow for unexpected things like sickness, going to the dentist, family emergencies, missing the bus, sleeping in, having a bad day, etc., we'll only count your best 90% of the participation grades. Your participation grade is actually made up of two parts: the clicker questions and the in-class exercises. For the latter, you'll be asked to submit a page for one of the in-class exercises that we did in class. The actual page to be turned in will be determined by the instructor, near the end of class. If your work for the given question spans more than one page, hand in the additional page(s).  <em>Anyone found submitting worksheets on behalf of another student will receive a grade of zero for the worksheet portion of the course.</em> Important: Be sure to put your student number (name optional) on the page that you turn in!  You will not get this page back; so, in case you want to refer to it in the future, you may wish to take a picture of it with your cell phone. Please note that we will NOT accept e-mail copies of your work and your work must be written on a printed copy of the worksheet.</p>
<p>Note 2: We will drop your worst lab mark. This allows for illness, dentist, family emergencies, missing the bus, etc. ... or if you happen to miss the programming lab submission deadline. The latter inevitably happens to some students when they don't submit their program in time. Be sure to pay attention to your TA's instructions! 15 minutes to the hour (near the end of your lab) is the deadline for submitting your work.</p>
<p>Note 3: In order to pass the course you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>obtain an overall grade of at least 50%</li>
<li>obtain a grade of at least 50% on the final exam</li>
<li>obtain an overall grade of at least 50% on the (best 8 out of 9) labs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you fail to satisfy either of the last two conditions, a final grade that is no greater than 45% will be assigned.</p>
<h3>Midterms</h3>
<p>Midterm 1: February 6, 2018, Time 18:30-19:30, Location TBD</p>
<p>Midterm 2: March 6, 2018, Time: 18:30-19:30, Location:  TBD</p>
<p>If you have a conflict with either of the scheduled midterms (e.g., you have another class in the same time slot), please contact your instructor <em>immediately</em>.</p>
<p>For midterm marking appeals, see the instructions on the discussion board and be sure to submit your appeal by the stated deadline.</p>
<br />
<h3>Final Exam</h3>
<p>The final exam will be scheduled by Enrollment Services. Exam schedules are normally released in mid-February. Please do not make any holiday travel plans until this schedule is released. Note that the last day of final exams this term is Wednesday, April 25, 2018. For the date/time/location of the exam, and your other final exams, check the Student Service Centre (SSC).</p>
<p>The final examination is a closed book exam. No calculators, books, or notes are allowed; The exam coverage includes all materials that were discussed in the course (screencasts, lecture notes, related textbook sections, in-class exercises, pre-labs, labs, ...). There will be no question on Excel on the final exam.</p>
<p>In case you miss a <em>final</em> exam due to illness or extreme hardship, you must report to Engineering Student Services as soon as possible and let your instructor know.  ESS screens the applications, and if approved, they will allow you to write a final exam in the future (usually in the summer for deferrals from winter term 2).</p>
