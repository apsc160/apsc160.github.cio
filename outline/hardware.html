        <h3>Guidelines on purchasing a laptop</h3>
        <p>Generally avoid anything describing itself as a Netbook.  Although they are small and very portable, many suffer from low resolution screens (1024 across by 768 deep), limited memory, poor processor performance, small capacity disk drives, limited USB and other connectivity issues, as well as a cut-down version of Windows that limits the number of applications that can run at a time. If portability is very important, look at Ultrabooks, Microsoft Surface, or MacBook Air/Pro models. Although these are a lot more expensive and will serve you better long term, it is recommended that you pay close attention to the limitations of any laptop described in the text below.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Operating System (OS)</b>: Many software tools that we use in ECE (and other engineering depts.) are only available to run under Windows (they don’t run under Apple OS X for example, and not all of them are available to run under Linux), so if you buy an Apple laptop you will probably, at some point in time have to install Windows on it to allow you to run that software at home. Apple computers (MacBook Air, Pro, iMac, etc.) can be set up to run Windows -- and you should be able to get a free version of Windows 7, 8 or 10 (there was no 9) through the University as part of a Microsoft licensing agreement.</p>

        <p> There are several ways to install Windows on an Apple laptop. For example, Apple produces their own software called Boot Camp, which is pre-installed on all Apple computers and is thus free and supported by Apple. You just have to run the Boot Camp program to install Windows. Boot Camp is very easy to use and the resulting Windows installation will be fast and reliable. However, the major downside of Boot Camp is that you have to reboot your computer when switching between Windows and Apple’s OS X.</p>

        <p>Other companies produce rival software to Boot Camp, such as Parallels, VirtualBox, VMWare Fusion, etc. that do not need to be rebooted when switching OS’s, in effect enabling Windows to be run as a “Window” under OS-X. The downside of these is that you may have to pay for some of them ($50 – $80).  There is a good review of these options here: <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2010694/review-parallels-desktop-8-vs-vmware-fusion-5.html" target="_blank">http://www.macworld.com/article/2010694/review-parallels-desktop-8-vs-vmware-fusion-5.html</a></p>

        <p>Whatever you choose, you still need to have a legal copy of Windows (even for Boot Camp). For simplicity, cost, and support with the installation, the ECE Department suggests you use either the free Boot Camp or VirtualBox, but you can use any of the others mentioned here. In some instances it might also be useful if you have a DVD writer or some kind of external USB disk drive when installing Windows.</p>

        <p><b>Choice of Processor</b>: Generally, a faster processor leads to a quicker laptop and less time waiting around for things to complete. These days any Intel (or equivalent AMD) processor such as the i3, i5 or i7 is more than up to the task of any work we carry out in ECE. Not many software packages benefit from having more than one processor core, so paying a premium for, say, a quad core i7, is generally not worth it. A dual core version of the same processor is more than adequate. It’s your choice as to how much you want to pay. An i7 processor is faster than an i5 which in turn is faster than an i3. You pay for that performance, but remember there are no bad choices here.</p>

        <p><b>Memory</b>: Recommended minimum - 4GB – These days, however, memory is very cheap so there is a speed benefit to having more of it, if you can afford it (e.g., 8 or 16GB) particularly if you buy an Apple and have to run Windows under say Virtual Box.
        </p>

        <p><b>Network</b>: Wireless networks are used extensively throughout UBC, so make sure your laptop supports wireless. Wireless networks have mostly replaced the “plug-in cable” (Ethernet) based networks around the campus.</p>

        <p><b>Disk Drive</b>: Most hard disk drives (HDDs) are at least 500GB these days and that should be more than sufficient. However many new laptops are replacing HDDs with Solid State Drives (SSDs). If you buy a laptop with an SSD, make sure it will be big enough. In particular, if you buy an Apple laptop (e.g., MacBook Air, MacBook Pro), you want to allow for the option of installing Windows alongside Mac OS X, as well as all the other Windows-based tools you will need for  your courses. For this reason, the absolute minimum spec you should consider for Apple laptops is 128GB of SSD, but that will not leave much space for lots of software and you may end having to uninstall software to create space for other software each term. It is highly recommended that you consider either a 256GB SSD and/or an external portable USB based disk drive (typical price for a 2TB drive is about $100).
        </p>

        <p><b>Screen</b>: It’s possible to work with screens as small as 11 inches when the resolution is not too high; but for the sake of your eyes, you might want to consider 13 or even 15 inch+ screens depending upon how important portability is to you.</p>

        <p><b>Screen Resolution</b>: This is often linked to screen size. The higher the resolution, the more “pixels” there are on the screen, and the easier it will be to see more of your work on the screen at the same time without having to shuffle the screen up/down and left/right. In theory, you can work with screens that have very low resolution, but you would be better off with a higher resolution.</p>

        <p>For example, some low resolution screens when used in conjunction with some software tools that we use in ECE offer very little space on the screen for typing/drawing etc. The MacBook Air 11” has a small 11 inch screen with a relatively low resolution and although it’s possible to work with this, for a modest additional cost you can get a 13 inch model with more resolution which will be easier to work with. Recommended minimum resolution is 1280 x 800 (or 1366 x 768), but more is definitely useful when coupled to a bigger screen.</p>

        <p><b>Connectivity</b>: One USB-3 port should be considered the absolute minimum, but more is an advantage allowing you to plug in more USB devices without having to shuffle them around. In the worst case, with one USB port, you might need an external USB hub that will expand connectivity;  these can be bought quite cheaply for around $30.</p>

        <p><b>Screen Connection</b>: Many students make presentations as part of their course and need to hook their laptop up to some large projector for an audience to view. For this reason you should consider an external VGA port (or adaptor in the case of Apple products) as the minimum requirement. However, the HDMI connector is gradually replacing VGA; so looking towards the future, it’s recommended that your laptop has an HDMI port (adaptor) also.
        </p>

        <p><b>CD/DVD Writer</b>: This is becoming more “useful” rather than “essential” and in any case can be bought later as an external USB type plug-in device, if it’s important. Apple laptops have dropped them as a standard but offer an external drive for about $70. Other manufacturers are doing similarly. They can be useful for backing up work and files etc., but most students invest in some kind of USB “thumb drive” or external HDD for backup. <span><span>Stiill</span></span>, it can be useful when installing software from a disk drive (e.g., Windows when you have an Apple computer).
        </p>

        <p><b>Mouse</b>: Useful rather than essential. Many students are happy with the track/touch pads built into laptops, but a mouse is faster and more controllable for high precision drawing than a track pad. A mouse can be USB cable or USB wireless or Bluetooth based. The latter would require a laptop with a Bluetooth wireless interface, while the other two would require a spare USB port.
