        <h3>Missed Examination</h3>
        <p>If you are unable to write the midterm due to illness or other extenuating circumstance, you must contact your instructor as soon as possible (and within 24 hours) to avoid a zero on the exam.  Do not wait until the next class. It is sufficient to send your instructor a short e-mail message to say that you will be unable to attend the exam. In the case of illness, a medical note from your doctor will be required.</p>

            <p>If you are unable to write the <em>final</em> exam, you will need to contact your faculty office (for most students, this will be Engineering Student Services), so that your situation is dealt with appropriately, and that you be approved to write a future exam for this course.</p>

        <h3>Missed Lab</h3>
        <p>If you are unable to attend your lab for any reason, then a grade of zero will be entered for that lab.  Please note however, that we only consider your <strong>best 8 out of 9 labs</strong> when computing your overall lab grade, to allow for situations like illness, dental appointment, missed bus, funeral, etc.  Be sure to do the practice lab, even if you are going to miss the upcoming lab!  In fact, we recommend that students do all 9 labs, if possible, since that will help prepare you for the final exam, and give you some solid programming experience that may be important in years to come.</p>
        <p>Please do not ask to swap labs or to make up the lab at another time as this cannot and will not be accommodated due to the complexity of setting up the lab's time-controlled drop boxes.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>
        <p>Don't cheat!  The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. (You agreed to these rules of conduct upon being admitted to UBC.)  At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas, and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or course component, and more serious consequences may apply at the discretion of the Dean's office or the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Furthermore, records are kept at the Dean's office to monitor and prevent recurrences.
        </p>
        <p>In this course, academic misconduct can occur in any of the following ways: copying part of someone else's code on an assignment, lab test, or exam; allowing someone to copy your code, in whole or in part, electronically or manually; viewing someone else's code on a computer screen and then copying it into your own code; allowing someone to view your code; sharing your UBC account (including giving away your password); hiring a tutor to write part of, or all of, the code; using two iClickers (e.g., a friend didn't go to the lecture, but you have decided to cheat for them); etc. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, it is merely intended to provide you with some concrete examples.
        </p>
        <p>Please be aware that both the person who copies and the person who allows their work to be copied are subject to penalties. The penalty for plagiarism can be suspension from the University, a grade of zero for the course, and a note on your transcript. (This has happened to students in this course or in other computing courses.)  Don't do it! It's really not worth it.</p>
        <p>All students should read and be familiar with the following section of the UBC Calendar: <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0" target="_blank">http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0</a>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Religious Holidays</h3>
        <p>Students who are scheduled to attend classes or write examinations on holy days of their religion are permitted to absent themselves from class or examination provided they give at least two week's notice to the instructor. For more details on this policy, please see UBC Policy #65: Religious Holidays.</p>
