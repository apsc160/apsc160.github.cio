<h3>Visual Studio</h3>
<p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an <em>integrated development environment</em> (IDE) that allows you to edit, compile, link, run, and debug your C programs. It will also allow you to work with other programming languages such as C++, C#, and Visual Basic; but, we will not be exploring these languages in this course. The IDE is installed for your use on all machines in the CEME 2212 student lab.</p>
<p>If you wish to be able to develop programs using your own computer at home (and it's recommended that you do!), you will need to install Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.</p>
<h4>What's the difference between Visual Studio Enterprise and Visual Studio Community?</h4>
<p>We will be using Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise Edition in the lab. This edition contains many more features than we really need in an introductory course. An alternate edition named Visual Studio 2017 Community is easier to install, requires less disk space, and can be downloaded for free from the Web via Microsoft.  The two editions look almost identical on the surface, and instructions provided for one edition will work equally well on the other.</p>
<p>(By the way, that special phrase that you are looking for in Lab 0 Part 1 is: "Welcome to APSC")</p>
<h3>Windows Users</h3>
<h4>How do I get a copy of Microsoft Windows?</h4>
<p>Microsoft Windows (version 8 or 10) is available to you for free as a student in an Applied Science Program at UBC, thanks to Microsoft's Imagine academic licensing program:</p>

<br />
<p>Note that it might take a few weeks after the start of term for your account on Microsoft Imagine to become active, although you'll typically get faster access.</p>
<p>Note that a version of Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise edition can be found on the Imagine site, but keep in mind that this version will require much more disk space for installation and that we will not be using many of the features that come with it. We recommend you install the Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition (see instructions below for how to download).</p>
<h4>How do I get a copy of Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition?</h4>
<p>Download and run the installation file by following the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/" target="_blank">https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/</a></p>
<p>You will need to Register the product to remove the 30-day trial. You can do this by following these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the "Help" menu, then select "Register Program"</li>
<li>Sign into your Microsoft account. If you don't have one, you will have to make one.</li>
<li>Click on the link "Check for Updated License" and it should update!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not see the "Visual C++ General" option shown highlighted below, click on the "Open Visual Studio Installer" link and install the Visual C++ option:<img src="images/CreatingANewProject.png" width="75%" /></p>
<p>Follow instructions in Lab 0 to create, compile and run your first program.</p>
<h3>Mac Users</h3>
<h4>How do I develop C programs on my Mac?</h4>
<p>You have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>XCode - a native Mac application</li>
<li>Visual Studio running in a Windows 10 virtual machine</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these two, the first is easier to set up but this will require you to become familiar with two different development environments: XCode <em>and</em> Visual Studio. Keep in mind that you will have to use Visual Studio in the lab each week. So, although the second option is more difficult to set up, it is the one we recommend.</p>
<h4>How do I install XCode on my Mac?</h4>
<p>If you wish to work with XCode, you can download it from the Mac App Store.</p>
<h4>How do I install Visual Studio on my Mac?</h4>
<p>As noted above, the recommended option is to install Visual Studio in a Windows 10 virtual machine on your Mac following <a href="formacusers.html">these instructions</a>. Note that you will need at least 8GB of memory and 32GB of free disk space.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you do not have a lot of disk space on your Mac (e.g. you bought a Mac Book Air with only 128GBs of Disk space), then you might find it a squeeze to install Windows, Visual Studio and all your OSX files onto that single disk. It is recommended in this case that you consider purchasing an external USB drive (1 and 2 TByte drives can be purchased for about $100 these days) and put some of your files onto that drive. This will of course mean that you have to take the drive with you.</p>
<h3>Sophos Anti-Virus Software</h3>
<p>Many of you will have rushed out over the summer and bought a shiny new laptop before starting UBC, perhaps a new Mac or a Windows-based machine. Even if you didn't and are using an older computer, it's important to keep your computer safe from viruses and other threats when going on-line. To help you with this, UBC has an agreement with Sophos Corporation, that allows all students registered at UBC to download Sophos anti-virus software for free.</p>
<p>It really is a very good package and works seamlessly with Windows (or a Mac with Windows installed on it - as some of you will do in this course) to protect your system from attack. If you have a reputable anti-virus software package installed on your computer and are happy with it, that's fine; continue to use it. However if you have a "less reputable" one, or worse, none at all, then you are <strong>strongly</strong> advised to install the Sophos software. You can download the software by visiting <strong>https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads</strong> and clicking on the download button. You will need your UBC campus wide login (CWL) to start the download. Last year we had a student whose computer was so infected with viruses and malware pop-ups that her machine became virtually unusable. It took her a long time (and she lost some grades) to get it straightened out.</p>
<h3>Security Practices</h3>
<p>Good security is both a mindset and a process; it is not a product.  Simply having anti-virus protection on your laptop is an important step in this process.  Avoid clicking on links that you do not trust.  Avoid opening attachments in e-mails that come from people you don't know, or for which the context of the message is not what you might expect.  A big security problem these days is ransomware.  This occurs when you click on a link placed by a hacker, and the link intentionally encrypts files on your machine.  Once this happens, there are only two solutions: (a) restore your files from a recent backup (and you did backup the files on your laptop or home machine recently, right?), or (b) pay the ransom to the hacker who will (usually) give you the decryption key to un-encrypt your files.  Many organizations/users who didn't have a recent backup have had to do (b); otherwise, their files would be lost forever.  Do not share accounts and passwords.  Choose good passwords.  Remember to sign out when you're done.  Make use of disk encryption features built-in to your operating system; then, if your laptop is stolen, no one will be able to read the files on your machine.  Use common sense.  Use a password on your smartphone.</p>
<p>In case you're interested, UBC has some excellent security and privacy guidelines that are available at this URL: <br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://cio.ubc.ca/sites/cio.ubc.ca/files/documents/standards/IS%20Standards%201-21.pdf">http://cio.ubc.ca/sites/cio.ubc.ca/files/documents/standards/IS%20Standards%201-21.pdf</a>.  <br />Many of these policies are required by UBC staff and faculty members to protect people's personal information, to secure UBC files, and to use best practices in computing.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Office 365 Software</h3>
<p>Chances are you'll also be wanting to open documents and spreadsheets etcm while at UBC. We'll certainly be using spreadsheets in this course, so if you don't have a copy of Microsoft Office already installed on your computer, you can download a free copy by visiting <a href="https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads" target="_blank">https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads</a></p>
