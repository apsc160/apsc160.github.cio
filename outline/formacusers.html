<h3>How to run Windows 10 on a Mac using VirtualBox</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download and install VirtualBox from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a> - select the version for "OS X Hosts"</li>
<li>Download the 64-bit Windows 10 disk image from <br /> <a href="https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/Security/SignIn.aspx?rurl=%2fWebStore%2fProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx%3fcmi_cs%3d1%26cmi_mnuMain%3dbdba23cf-e05e-e011-971f-0030487d8897%26ws%3dd00cd56c-ae8b-e011-969d-0030487d8897%26vsro%3d8&amp;ws=d00cd56c-ae8b-e011-969d-0030487d8897&amp;vsro=8" target="_blank">https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/Security/SignIn.aspx?rurl=%2fWebStore%2fProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx%3fcmi_cs%3d1%26cmi_mnuMain%3dbdba23cf-e05e-e011-971f-0030487d8897%26ws%3dd00cd56c-ae8b-e011-969d-0030487d8897%26vsro%3d8&amp;ws=d00cd56c-ae8b-e011-969d-0030487d8897&amp;vsro=8</a> <br />- note that you will need to log in with your CWL ID and password. Do not attempt to run the file that you download!</li>
<li>Start VirtualBox and click the "New" icon to create a new Windows 10 virtual machine. When you are done, the dialog should look as follows: <img src="images/VirtualBox_NewOS.png" width="75%" /> <br />- click Continue.</li>
<li>In the next step, choose the recommended memory size.</li>
<li>Next, choose "Create a hard disk now", select "VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)", then select "Dynamically Allocated", set the size to 32GB and click "Create".</li>
<li>You have two options for logging in to Windows 10: using a Microsoft account or a local account. If you wish to use a Microsoft account, create one now at <a href="https://live.com" target="_blank">https://live.com</a>. If you do not wish to create a Microsoft account, disconnect your machine from the Internet at this point - this will prevent the installation process from prompting you for your Microsoft account ID.</li>
<li>Now select your virtual machine and click the "Start" button.</li>
<li>You will be asked to select a virtual optical disk file. Navigate to the file that you downloaded from the Microsoft Imagine website and click "Start". Select language and keyboard options then click "Install Now".</li>
<li>Read and accept the terms of the license agreement.</li>
<li>For type of installation, select "Custom: Install Windows Only (advanced)" then click "Next". The installation process will then start.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts during the installation process, selecting "Canada" as your country and US English as the language.</li>
<li>If you do not wish to use a Microsoft account to log in, select "Skip for now" when prompted to connect to a network. You will then be prompted for your name and password - this is the local account that you will use to log in to Windows 10. Otherwise, log in with your Microsoft account ID and password.</li>
<li>Follow the remaining prompts for setting up Windows 10.</li>
<li>If you disconnected your machine from the Internet, now is the time to reconnect it.</li>
<li>From the "Devices" menu, select "Insert Guest Additions CD Image..."</li>
<li>Open file explorer and navigate to the CD Drive labelled "VirtualBox Guest Additions" <img src="images/GuestAdditions.png" width="75%" /></li>
<li>Double-click VBoxWindowsAdditions and follow the prompts to install the software - select all default options. When the process completes, select the option to re-boot the machine.</li>
<li>When Windows restarts, log in again and then from the "View" menu, select "Full screen mode". You now have Windows 10 running in a full screen on your Mac!</li>
</ol>
