                In this take-home lab, you will create a program to display
                a scrolling message on the 7-segment displays of the DAQ.  There
                are two opportunities for bonus marks in this lab, allowing you
                to earn up to 125%.  Note, however, that the bonus marks will
                not allow you to get more than 100% on your "overall" lab mark,
                though it will help you to improve your marks of earlier labs
                (e.g. lab 7, 6, 5, ...).

              <h3>Learning Goals:</h3>

              <ul>
                <li>To write a program in C that displays a scrolling message on LED displays</li>
                <li>To write non-digit characters to 7-segment displays</li>
                <li>To practice reading from switches (digital inputs) as control device</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                You will write a program in C that displays a message
                on the LED screen and scrolls this message across the LED screen. Note
                that the term LED screen is used to refer to a number of 7-segment
                LED displays arranged in a row. This lab has a required part
                (to earn up to 100%) and a bonus part (added functionality) to earn
                up to 125% on this lab. The program must work to earn the bonus marks.
              </p>

                <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This lab is different from previous
                C programming labs, in that <span style="color: red;">you can do this
                lab at home</span>, i.e. you are not required to attend your
                lab section to do this lab (please see the "Lab Access" section below).
                Everybody has the same programming assignment and the
                <span style="color: red;">same due date</span>, as posted on Connect.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong><span style="color: red">Plagiarism:</span></strong>
                Since you will be doing this lab at home, some of you may be
                tempted to copy the work of somebody else, and submit it as
                your own. We have various tools to check for copying, so it is much
                better to get a low mark for this lab, rather than risk the
                consequences of plagiarism (i.e. getting a zero, up to getting
                suspended from UBC). Note that both the person copying the code and the
                person allowing his/her code to be copied will both face the penalties
                of plagiarism.
              </p>
              <p>
                While you are allowed to discuss the design/algorithm for your
                programs, the safest way to avoid "accidentally" copying someone
                else's code is to not look at someone else's code, or to allow
                them to look at your code. In addition, if you are working in
                the lab, please make sure that you delete your code from the
                computer after you are done, to ensure nobody else copies it. Even
                if somebody copies your code without your consent or knowledge,
                you may still be responsible.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are having problems with your program which you cannot
                resolve, then it is best to talk to one of the TAs or the
                instructor. In addition to the usual office hours, TAs will be
                available during many of the regularly scheduled lab sessions,
                as noted below under <strong>Lab Access</strong>.
              </p>

              <h3>Lab Access</h3>

              In order to develop and test your program, you will have the
              following options:
              <ul>
                <li>use the DAQ library/simulator on your own computer; </li>
                <li>use the DAQ library/simulator on the computers in the lab (CEME2212); </li>
                <li>use the DAQ library and the real hardware module in the lab (CEME2212).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The lab room CEME2212 is open and usually available 24 hours a day,
                unless otherwise posted. Please note that the CEME building is not
                necessarily open 24 hours. If you are in the lab after the building closes,
                please have appropriate ID to verify your status.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, there will be scheduled TA office hours during the week,
                where TAs will be available to answer any questions, and to provide
                a hardware module if desired. Please see the schedule posted on Connect.
